# 📸 Photomory

**Photomory** is a cozy little space on the internet where I’ve combined some of my favorite things: photography, cats, doodling, memories, and the joy of building something from scratch.

This project started from a simple love of taking pictures — especially of cats 🐱 — and the desire to create a digital corner to keep those moments. But over time, it became more than that. It’s a celebration of small joys, a personal design challenge, and a hands-on way to explore full-stack development with a bit of fun and flair.

## 🌟 What It Does

Photomory lets users upload their favorite images, assign them to categories, and keep them safe — all in a warm, playful interface. Think of it as a digital memory box, but with a bit more personality.

- ✨ Upload images to categories(only me hehe)
- 🐾 Add custom folders for doodles, pet pics, anything!(only me hehe)
- 🔐 Authentication with Firebase (only I can upload for now)
- 🌈 Custom-designed UI — soft colors, handpicked fonts, and all the vibes
- 🔗 Links out to GitHub + Figma if you're curious about the behind-the-scenes

## 🎨 The Design Philosophy

I really wanted Photomory to *feel* like me — from the colors and fonts to the little stories behind each photo. The earlier version of this site was a bit clunky, so I decided to start over with a cleaner layout and better flow, using tools I’ve learned along the way.

- Soft colors that feel like nostalgia
- Rounded cards, playful text, and attention to tiny details
- Hand-drawn doodles in the design to add a human touch

## 💌 A Little Personal Note

I’m someone who finds joy in capturing small moments — a cat stretching in the sun, a messy sketch I like, a silly photo I took on a trip. **Photomory** is just me trying to make space for those things.

It’s not just about tech, though I’ve learned a ton building it. It’s also about building something meaningful — something that makes me smile every time I open it.
